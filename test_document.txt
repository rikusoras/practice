This is a pre-block
it has info that we don't really need
it might have g0 info
like this
G0 = X0 Y0 Z0
But we don't want this
Think of way to filter, or just leave it for later
can also manually change this thing too

G1 X50 Y150 F10 E5
G1 X150 Y50 G10
G0 X40 Y75 G7
G1 X70 Y40

new layer

G1 X50 Y60
G0 X25 Y75
G1 X70 Y80

This is an end block
it is not as annoying as the preblock
shouldn't be any significant problems here
